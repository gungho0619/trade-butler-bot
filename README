## TBB - Trade Butler Bot
** TBB Token Address - 0x4a7adcb083fe5e3d6b58edc3d260e2e61668e7a2 **
** LP Token Address - 0x4f839e991bb8c66b7066e2d4d753f47613f4d558 **

1. wallet-keys.js - add your private key and wallet address.
   Note that ONLY buysell.js uses these keys for the standard
   uniswap contracts and token spending approval.

2. setup.js - get an Infura and/or Alchemy API key, both aren't
   necessary but it's a good idea to have at least one for rate
   limits. You can setup most other configuration variables here.

3. index.js - add tokens you want to scan here. Make sure your wallet
   is either already approved to spend on uniswap, or you turn variable
   needTokenApproval to true. Make sure to turn it to false after
   allowing one round of approval or else the script will approve each
   time. If uniswap router cannot spend your tokens, you will fail tx
   when trying to sell!

4. Install Node.JS for your OS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
   For Windows users, you may find it most convenient to just download the correct version right away:
   14.15.1 - https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.15.1/node-v14.15.1-x64.msi

5. Make sure your Node.js is the correct version (using npm): 14.15.1
   `npm cache clean -f`
   `npm install -g n`
   `n 14.15.1`

   (not needed on windows if you downloaded exact version)

6. Extract files into a folder and open a terminal or cmd.exe
   Navigate to your folder with:
   `cd /path/to/bot`
   OR
   `cd C:\Files\Path\to\bot`

7. Run the following commands to install modules, 
   you only need to run this command once: 
   `npm install`
